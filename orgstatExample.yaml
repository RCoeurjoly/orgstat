# This is example orgstat configuration file. Sadly it's still 
# poor, so check out Config.hs for more options if needed.

# Scopes are sets of org-mode files you consider as one
# working tree. Different possible scopes are possible, but
# in general it's convenient to work with a single one, controlling
# output with scope modifiers.
scopes:
  - paths: [/home/username/org/study.org, /home/username/org/work.org, /home/username/org/private.org.gpg]
  - name: alternative
    paths: [/home/username/secretAgentLife.org]
# Default configuration for timeline
timelineDefault:
  colWidth: 1.2         # width of single timeline column
  colHeight: 1.1        # height of single timeline column
  topDay: 8             # number of items in per-day longest-top list
  legend: true          # should legend be shown (true by default)
  background: '#ff00aa' # background color, grey by default
reports:
  # Current week, all tasks
  - name: curWeekFull
    range: week # month-1, week-5, day-3 are possible (as in org-mode)
  # Current week, only work/study
  - name: curWeekTop
    range: week
    # scope: default # 'default' is the default scope, but you 
    # can chose another one
    modifiers:
      # Prune modifier goes to node on path and transforms all  
      # noes at depth 'depth' into leaves, collecting their
      # timestamps into one

        path: /study/
        depth: 1
      - type: prune
        path: /work/

  # Only study, previous week
  - name: prevWeekStudy
    range: week-1
    modifiers: 
      # Select does 'cd' into the chosen node.

    modifiers:
