## This is example orgstat configuration file. Sadly it's still 
## poorly documented, so check out Config.hs for more options in 
## case something is missing.


# Scopes are sets of org-mode files you consider as one single
# working tree. Different possible scopes are possible, but
# in general it's convenient to work with a single one, controlling
# output with scope modifiers.
scopes:
  # Scope without name is given the name "default". 
  # In this particular example, the scope is represented by tree with 
  # three root directories: /study/, /work/, and /private/. 
  - paths: [/home/username/org/study.org, /home/username/org/work.org, /home/username/org/private.org.gpg]
  # This creates a tree with only one /secretAgentLife/ root directory.
  - name: alternative
    paths: [/home/username/secretAgentLife.org]

# Reports are temporary internal representations of summaries that
# we want to later output. Report works within the scope, applying 
# modifiers that change the working tree.
reports:
  # Current week, all tasks
  - name: curWeekFull
    range: week # month-1, week-5, day-3 are possible (as in org-mode)
  # Current week, only work/study
  - name: curWeekTop
    range: week
    # scope: default # 'default' is the default scope, but you 
    # can chose another one
    modifiers:
      # Prune modifier goes to node on path and transforms all  
      # noes at depth 'depth' into leaves, collecting their
      # timestamps into one
      - type: prune
        path: /study/
        depth: 1
      - type: prune
        path: /work/
        depth: 1
  # Only study, previous week
  - name: prevWeekStudy
    range: week-1
    modifiers: 
      # Select does 'cd' into the chosen node.
      - type: select 
        path: study
      - type: prune
        path: /
        depth: 2
  - name: prevWeekWork
    range: week-1
    modifiers:
      - type: filterbytag
        tag: work # Tag name
        # Multiple tags are supported (as in "a|b")
        # tags: [work,study] # 

# Outputs are the ways to represent/materialise the reports. One report can
# be outputed in several different ways. There is a discrete number of
# outputs available.
outputs:

  # Timeline output, it outputs the timeline svg from the report.
  - name: curWeekFullTimeline
    type: timeline
    report: curWeekFull
  - name: curWeekTopTimeline
    report: curWeekTop
    type: timeline
    background: '#ffaa77' # Optional

  # Statistics output accumulates total report durations into variable 
  # and injects them into the given template. Finally, it writes the 
  # resulting string into the file.
  - name: thisWeekStats
    type: summary
    template: "work: %prevWeekWork%, study: %prevWeekStudy%"

  # Script output is the generalisation of the previous one.
  # It will take a script and execute it with durations of 
  # reports injected as environment variable with the same name.
  - name: scriptOutput
    type: script
    # One can choose between inline script or a path to the file
    inline: "echo $prevWeekWork > file.txt"
    # scriptPath: /path/to/script.sh

    # Reports to consider. Since we don't know generally what reports
    # are used inside the script, they can be specified here.
    # If this list is empty (default), then *all* reports will
    # be ran and injected!
    reports: [prevWeekWork] 

  # Block output is something similar to the org-report -- it builds
  # a table with items and durations. Is useful for debugging.
  - name: blockOutput
    type: block
    unicode: true # Optional, default true
    maxLength: 60 # Optional, default 80
    report: curWeekTop
 


# Must contain all todo keywords you use in files, because
# otherwise parsed headings' titles will contain them prepended.
todoKeywords: [ TODO, STARTED, WAITING, DONE, CANCELED ]

# Default outputs parent folder. Subfolder for the particular output 
# will be auto-generated. 
outputDir: /home/username/reps/orgstat/


# Optional parameters controlling timeline output:

# TODO Move salt to timeline params
colorSalt: 3 # Salt that controls coloring of report items, default 0 
timelineDefault:
  colWidth: 1.2         # Width of single timeline column, default 1
  colHeight: 1.1        # Height of single timeline column, default 1
  topDay: 8             # Number of items in per-day longest-top list, default 5
  legend: true          # Should legend be shown, default true
  background: '#ff00aa' # Background color, default #f2f2f2
